The project is a data table with the following fields: Name, surname, phone number and address. 
The console application enables the user by entering the appropriate code to add a new contact 
with the appropriate fields, delete the contact's data, change the value of any field of the contact, 
extract all the contacts matching a certain value of any field and, of course, see the list of all 
contacts in the form of a table. Table sizes are flexible: depending on the values contained in it,
it can increase and decrease. The program does not allow entering wrong (in terms of type) values and 
prompts accordingly. There is also a limit on the number of imported symbols (maximum 30 symbols). 
When there is more than one contact with a given value in the table, the program identifies the contact 
using the other fields before taking any action. The complete matching of contacts makes the uniqueness 
of phone numbers impossible.
An ordinary text file is used as a data store.
The project is continuously updated and functionality is added.
